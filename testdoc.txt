Amazon EC2 is a web service that allows you to launch virtual machines on demand “in the cloud”. To use EC2, you can register for an Amazon AWS account here: http://aws.amazon.com/

Write a script or scripts designed to execute on a typical Linux machine that will launch a given number of Amazon EC2 instances. Each instance, having started successfully, should fetch a specified Jetty version, install it, and launch it. This is a test of your ability to write easy to read, maintainable code. The scripts can be in any language but should be production quality. 

Assume that the main script will be run as:
[script-name] -n [number-of-instances] [jetty-version]

and that the variables $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY exist in the environment.

You will need to use the ec2-run-instances command:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-RunInstances.html
The command line tools are available here: http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/351

Use an Amazon Linux instance store AMI to launch the instances. These AMI's are listed here: http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/

You may also find the user-data and CloudInit mechanisms useful in this task. You can find information on these here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html
and here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonLinuxAMIBasics.html?r=5252

Finally, Jetty versions are available here:
http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/
 
Use any tools, practices, resources, and information you would normally use to complete production-quality code. If any of the instructions are unclear, make a reasonable assumption and document it with a comment.

You have two hours to complete the test. Please return your answer by email, by attaching a .zip file. Your implementation should be production quality. Use any tools, practices, resources, and information you would normally use to complete production-quality code. Please keep the content of the test confidential.
Thank you for your time, and good luck!
